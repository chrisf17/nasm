2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page.
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination for the fork.

## Running the Codespace

Now that you have forked the repository, you can run the Codespace from your fork.

1. Open your forked repository in GitHub.
2. Click on the "Code" button and copy the HTTPS or SSH URL.
3. Open GitHub Codespaces by clicking on the "Code" button and selecting "Open with Codespaces" from the dropdown menu.
4. Choose the option to "Create a codespace".
5. Paste the copied URL into the prompt and press Enter.
6. Wait for GitHub Codespaces to set up your environment.
7. Once the setup is complete, you will be dropped into a fully configured development environment where you can start working with the project.

That's it! You're now ready to start coding in your GitHub Codespace. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, feel free to reach out to us. Happy coding!
